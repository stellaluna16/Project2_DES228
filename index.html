 <p>
Took my chances on a big jet plane<br>
Never let 'em tell you that they're all the same<br>
Oh, the sea was red and the sky was grey<br>
Wondered how tomorrow could ever follow today<br>
The mountains and the canyons start to tremble and shake<br>
The children of the sun begin to awake (Watch out)<br>
